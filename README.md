# Bert-tf2
Implement BERT on Tensorflow 2.* using the TF hub pre-trained BERT model and the official model repository of Tensorflow.
The main reason behind this project is that I couldn't find any straightforward implementation of BERT. This was also part of my learning about the recent changes on NLP.
As a use case, the notebook existing in this repository uses BERT for the classification of movie reviews.
## Installation
The notebook runs on Python 3.* and Tensorflow 2.1 or later.

To use it, you can:
- Clone this repository and [tensorflow/models](https://github.com/tensorflow/models) in the same folder.
- or simply clone with submodules: `git -recursive clone Bert-tf2`
